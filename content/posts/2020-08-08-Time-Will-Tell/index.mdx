## Time Flies

<div>
  <AboutText>
    &emsp;When I wake up in the morning I tend to overthink about the day
    forward and sometimes that gets me nowhere but a bowl of cereal around 12pm
    wondering why I haven't left my room. I think about my life and what I
    expect it should be weeks from now and sometimes months. I guess I'm a
    little too hard on myself. So the day goes by and I remember why I'm in this
    position in life and what plans I need to make moving forward cause time
    does fly.

## Decisions

<div>
  <AboutText>
    &emsp;Time slows down when you're in the moment so why not just be in the
    moment? As if it was that easy. The journey in my life was to change my
    outcome, that's why I chose <b>Computer Science</b>. This field has many
    paths for you to go into. It's a great thing but at times it's not. I
    started learning Android Development only because I knew Java from what I've
    learned in school. Mobile App Development was always a high interest of mines but not
    for Android phones üòÖ so that left me falling deeper into a black hole <b> especially being stuck with a windows laptop </b>. That
    is until I found about React and React Native üòé.

  <AboutText>
    Sometimes to find out the food you don't like you have to taste it. In my case, that was Java so I had to make the move to JavaScript.
    I didn't want to see myself working at a big bank nor a company that didn't feel like it was legacy code written all over it. Not to bash Java because it gave me a great foundation, but sometimes you have to left things go.

## Choosing React

<div>
  <AboutText>
    &emsp;Frontend was something I frowned upon until I saw immediate results in the web page. Thought to myself  what is this black magic. No building of the Gradle? Whaa?!?! This was my first step into HTML and CSS. After a few landing pages and some color palettes... it was time to give JavaScript more attention.
    So I search Google <b>&quot;JavaScript Tutorial&quot;</b> this gave me back Tutorials on React from Udemy üòÅ. So I was like F*&* !T right? Talk about a bad decision, it felt like looking at an exam you never studied for. But, the hope wasn't lost. I stuck through it just complete the tutorials. And... Tada! I become a terrible programmer.

## All in All

<div>
  <AboutText>
    &emsp;I began Frontend Development because I grew a passion and love for showcasing what I can bring to the world. Solving problems that can change how a person feels or interact with an application shows the true work of art in this specialization. From choosing the right colors to drawing up a wireframe, it's such a broad area so making the switch doesn't feel like you'll have to learn something entirely new. I'll be happy to express my technical writings with all of you and the libraries I might tinker with. Thanks, for Reading! üôÉ
