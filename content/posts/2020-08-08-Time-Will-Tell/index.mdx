## Time Flies

<div>
  <AboutText>
    &emsp;When I wake up in the morning I tend to overthink about the day
    forward and sometimes that gets me nowhere but a bowl of cereal around 12pm
    wondering why I haven't left my room. I think about my life and what I
    expect it should be weeks from now and sometimes months. I guess I'm a
    little too hard on myself. So the day goes by and I remember why I'm in this
    position in life and what plans I need to make moving forward cause time
    does fly.

## Decisions

    &emsp;Time slows down when you're in the moment so why not just be in the
    moment? As if it was that easy. The journey in my life was to change my
    outcome, that's why I chose <b>Computer Science</b>. This fields has many
    paths for you to go into. It's a great thing but at times it's not. I
    started learning Android Development only because I knew Java from what I've
    learned in school. Mobile App Development was always a high interest but not
    for Android phones ðŸ˜… so that left me falling deeper into a black hole. That
    is until I found about React and React Native ðŸ˜Ž
